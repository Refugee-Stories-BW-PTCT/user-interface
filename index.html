        <h2>World Refugee Crisis Explained</h2>

        <p>
          The U.N.'s refugee agency reports that the number of displaced people
          is at its highest ever -- surpassing even post-World War II numbers,
          when the world was struggling to come to terms with the most
          devastating event in history. The total at the end of 2015 reached
          65.3 million -- or one out of every 113 people on Earth, according to
          the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The number
          represents a 5.8 million increase on the year before.

        <h3>What is the Refugee Crisis?</h3>

        <p>
          Worldwide, 22.5 million refugees, half of them children, have left
          everything behind to escape conflict, violence and persecution; many
          have experienced profound physical and emotional traumas. Some are
          missing years of school, severely compromising their futures. Children
          travelling alone are especially vulnerable – if they make it at all
          while others are starved out of their homelands due to drought and
          conflict.

          <h3>Sponsor a Refugee Child Like Yara</h3>

          <p>
            Children make up more than half of the world’s 22.5 million
            refugees. Many have known nothing but war, deprivation and fear.
            They aren’t in school and often struggle to find the basic
            essentials – their lives and futures at risk.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can help. By sponsoring a refugee child in Egypt, like Yara, you
            can be a hero in her life and in the lives of other children in her
            community. With your steady support, they’ll finally have the chance
            to grow up healthy, learning and safe. Because every child,
            everywhere, deserves a future.
